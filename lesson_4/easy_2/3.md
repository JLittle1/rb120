You can use the `ancestors` method to get an array of a class's ancestors, which can also be used to view the class's method lookup path. For example, the lookup chain for `Orange` is:
```
Orange
Taste
Object
Kernel
BasicObject
```
And for `HotSauce` it's:
```
HotSauce
Taste
Object
Kernel
BasicObject
```

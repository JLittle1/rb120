`@@cats_count` counts all instances of `Cat` objects that are created. It's a class variable, so it's shared by all instances of `Cat`. Whenever a `Cat` object is initialized, it calls the `initialize` instance method, which increments `@@cats_count` by `1`. You can access the value by calling the `cats_count` class method. Example:
```ruby
Cat.cats_count # => 0
Cat.new('calico')
Cat.new('egyptian')
Cat.cats_count # => 2
```

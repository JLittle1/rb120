The instance of a `Car` object can call the `go_fast` instance method on itself. That method returns a string made with string interpolation. One of the interpolated values is `self.class`. `self` refers to the calling object of the `go_fast` method, and the `class` method returns the class of the calling object, in this case the `Car` object. Therefore the evaluation of `self.class` is the `Car` class, which is implicitly converted to a string with `to_s`.
